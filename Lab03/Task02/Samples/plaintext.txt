For several years I’ve lived in an old building where three lime trees lean over the façade and dust the steps each June. In the early hours, before the first tram groans awake, the street is as thin as paper. You can hear a newspaper being unfolded in the kiosk, the creak of a bicycle rack, the faint buzz of a sign that was never properly fixed. A bakery opens across the way, and heat rolls out in a small, invisible wave. People arrive with soft voices and exact change, and for a moment we all pretend we know each other better than we do.
